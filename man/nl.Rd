\description{
Construct a new nl object
}
\details{
nl objects are the main class objects used in the nlrx package.
These objects store all information that is needed to run NetLogo simulations.
nl objects are initialized with basic information on Netlogo and the model.
To run simulation experiments, a experiment needs to be added to the nl object.
Each experiment also needs to have a specified simulation design in order to run simulations.
